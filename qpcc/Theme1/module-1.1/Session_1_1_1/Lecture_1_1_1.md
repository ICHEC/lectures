# Lecture 1.1.1

- What are Quantum Technologies and the pillars (communication, sensing/metrology, simulation, computing)?  
- What is the value proposition for Quantum Computing?
- How is QC fundamentally different from classical computing?
	- Introduction to Qubits, entanglement, interference example using coins (Susskind book)
	- Annealing vs gate-based QC – qubit numbers and application areas
- How is QC positioned alongside (within) classical computing and HPC?
- What are the potential application areas/sectors where QC is of interest (scientific, industry, etc.)? 
	- Quantum Security - cryptography, QKD, etc
- Brief introduction to current capabilities and limitations of QC.
	- Noisy vs Ideal QCS (physical vs logical qubits)
	- NISQ vs Fault-free algorithms
	- Quantum Memory
- Key activities and players (nations, programmes, technology developers and users).
- Access to QC resources (systems, training, materials).
- Overview of QPCC.
